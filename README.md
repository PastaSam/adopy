# adopy
A python script to change all serial keys of selected Adobe applications

Adobe products are great. But they're also *really* expensive. Thankfully, they offer a trial. And access to the applications XML files. This script changes the serial keys of selected Adobe applications, quickly and easily, so you don't have to do it. 

## Config

This script is easy to reconfigure, but requires some manual editting. The goal is to have a single python file that you edit once to cover all the Adobe applications you have installed, and never have to change it again.
